/*Approved by Administrators*/

Unlike the Wild West of most of the Internet, we have a very strict comment policy on our portal <a href="https://cuttack.top">**cuttack.top**</a>. If you’re an a`**`hole, you’ll be banned. Sorry, a`**`holes!

That, most important, statement out of the way, here’s more you should know whether you’re a regular commenter or new to the site.

If your comment does not immediately appear on the site after posting, it may have been flagged for review. There are a number of things which will get your comment flagged for review, we ask that you please keep that in mind before resubmitting the comment multiple times or contacting me about it.

* Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs Disqus has on their blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it won’t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.
* Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.
* Fluctuations in the space time continuum. Sometimes things just get auto-flagged and we don’t know why.
* Comments can also be flagged for review by my readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes my moderation jobs a lot harder).

### Here are some things which will get your comment deleted.

* Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post/website. This can run from name calling to sentences which include the words “people like you” or statements which begin “I bet you” or “you must/probably” etc. This is regardless of what “side” you’re on.
* Jokes or aggressive negative comments on the aesthetic appearance of a person (commenters, writers, and folks mentioned in an article alike).
* Hate speech or other clearly intentional jerk behaviour. This includes, but is not limited to: the use of the word feminazi or a comments which denigrates women, feminism or feminists, the LGBTQ community; broad imprecations or assumptions based on race; and anything that amounts to “ugh the gays,” “ugh liberals,” “ugh, fangirls,” etc.

There will be some who look at these rules and think that the we have too much power to shut down conversations. We have one responses to this.

First & Last: **It’s our site, we get to make the rules**. We're not taking away your freedom of speech by deleting/banning you. You can take your anger elsewhere, we don’t want it.

*The comment system is powered by Disqus. All the data is saved by Disqus and we have limited access to the user data only through Disqus admin panel. Please visit <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for more details. You can opt out using your Disqus Account.*
