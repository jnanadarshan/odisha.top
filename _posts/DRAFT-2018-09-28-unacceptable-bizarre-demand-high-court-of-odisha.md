Let's agree, Cuttack has lost its charm over the last few decades. Especially after 2010 when BJP lost Cuttack and BJD won CMC elections. Neither the MLAs nor successive Mayors of the ruling party opposed the systematic destruction of Cuttack over the years. More than 100 offices have been relocated to Bhubaneswar with thousands of people moving with jobs. Development has only been in pen and papers with many big projects limited to announcements and inauguration.

Odisha Police HQ and Odisha HC are undeniably the only two remaining jewels of the otherwise dormant Cuttack. Initially having an edge in the education sector we've since lost the bus of getting good educational institutions in the city. Due to political apathy, we didn't get either IIT, IIM or NEISER, though each time just for namesake Cuttack Collector was asked for identification of land just to show we're not being ignored. Cuttack though has the potential to get an Infocity near Baranga as it is closer to Infocity Patia, in a sheer negligence the Infocity-II project was started near Khordha. IIT Kharagpur identified Naraj area as the best place for an International Airport but again Government decided to move that to Khordha.

Its called Twin City just for namesake, in terms of development we lack far behind the capital. One by one many offices have been shifted to Bhubaneswar and so-called BJD leaders are silent over the issue. Odisha Police HQ is at Cuttack just in pen and paper. Many important sections like Passport Verification, Intelligence, Crime Branch Economic Offence Wing have been shifted to Bhubaneswar. Even DG has a camp office in Comissonerate HQ where he spends his most time. **Odisha High Court is the last jewel of Cuttack**, but Government is playing politics to satisfy people in western and southern Odisha by proposing to create two permanent benches which will reduce cases and importance of the Cuttack High Court. But what we find bizarre and absolutely unacceptable lawyers of Bhubaneswar today blocked Cuttack-Puri road and demanded to shift of Odisha HC to Bhubaneswar from Cuttack.

Our opinion is, we're responsible for this situation. Cuttackias have become so lazy for their rights that people are literally aiming to steal our most prized posssions from us. If you're a Cuttackis stand against this injustice. Hold your corporator and MLAs responsible. At the end we can only say:

>**ଉଠ କଙ୍କାଳ, ଉଠ ଦୁର୍ବଳ, ଜାଗ କଙ୍କାଳ ଆଜି
ଉଠୁ ଗତ ଗୌରବ, ହୃତ ଗୌରବ, ମୃତ ଗୌରବ ରାଜି ୤|୤**
