Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) has published an RFP of tender for branding activities around campaign named **BHUBANESWAR.ME**. What might be a oversight or negligence the CV format asked for RFP has asked capabilities on three languages, Hindi, English & **Bengali**. Yes, you heard it right, Bengali. But surprisingly Odia is missing from the list. Can we expect a fraction of outrage and media coverage that happened during Abhijit Iyer's comments?

You can find the original file here - <a href="http://bdabbsr.in/fileact.do?status=download&status1=tender&id=2662"> Original File</a>
