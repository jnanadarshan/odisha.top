#### Who we are?
We are Odia people specifically from Cuttack who are living outside Odisha for quite some time. Some of us are Consultants, Software Engineers, Salespeople and other professionals from various fields. We have two movements, Odisha First that will focus on issues at Odisha level and Cuttack First which will focus on city specific issues.

#### Why this effort?
Living outside Odisha for quite some time, we're fed up with the pace at which Odisha is moving. We want to come back home but lack of opportunity forces us to be outside for survival. We're seeing the development activities at Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune and even smaller cities like Trivandrum and Indore but major cities in Odisha are still lacking good career opportunities. We want to change that. By sitting outside and shouting nothing is happening will not change anything, thats why we've decided to address the matter full frontal.

#### Are we going to talk politics?
Yes! We very much intent to talk and centre our discussions around politics in Odisha. We believe it's necessary for political class to have the passion for the state which will be catalyst in development of Odisha.

#### Which party do we support?
Let's make this clear. We do not support any party. Having said that we support good people from across party lines. We support people from BJD, BJP, Congress and other independent parties. We also oppose people from BJD, BJP, Congress and independent parties who are no good for Odisha.

#### What are we going to do?
We are targeting educated Odia mass, who're living outside Odisha as well as students who will enter the work force in next couple of years. This is very crucial for us. We need to create jobs for knowledge based jobs in Odisha. We can not allow well educated Odia people to leave Odisha forever, in this way our state will never achieve the desired development goals.

### How can you join our movement?
You can contact on Facebook or drop an email to web[at]cuttack[dot]top with your details. Please note we only select serious Odia folks as our contributors and who are willing to give 1/2 Hours per week for the cause. It doesn't matter you're in Odisha or India or outside India, if you're committed then you're welcome.
