The term “Knowledge Worker” was first coined by marketing guru Peter Drucker in his book, The Landmarks of Tomorrow (1959). These are the workers in IT, Consulting, financial services industries, technology, law and science. While manufacturing sector creates more jobs with same investment amount directly and indirectly, knowledge industry is more important in 21st century. Manufacturing allows people with moderate skills and with wide education levels to get jobs. People working in knowledge industries are required to be highly educated and skilled at their job.

Its without any doubt that there is no significance knowledgebased industry base in Odisha. Without enough knowledge based jobs in Odisha, these educated people are being forced to migrate from Odisha. It's easy for a political party to satisfy the poor and un-educated mass by just providing stable work opportunities, food security and free housing. But it is much more difficult to satisfy the knowledge industry workers. Think about this a normal worker in a steel plant who can just meet his end needs with a job will be very happy when Government provides subsidised food, housing and other facilities like child-care support, old-age support etc. But to satisfy a banker or IT employee Govt needs to create an environment which will bring more and more businesses in and will increase his/her opportunity. It's difficult to fool an educated mass with freebees and soaps, until and unless there is actual development. There is also a huge feedback loop here. People in knowledge industries earn more and pay more taxes which increases Government funds for development. Again, these workers have more disposable income which increases the business base in the state. Therefore it is the need of the hour to force the Government of Odisha to bring more and more knowledge jobs to Odisha.
